    <p>To make Lasagna, you must prepare both a hearty meat or marinara sauce (Ragu) and a creamy white sauce (Béchamel). The dish is constructed in a deep baking tray by alternating layers: a thin coat of sauce at the bottom, followed by lasagna pasta sheets, the Ragu, the Béchamel, and a layer of ricotta/Parmesan cheese mixture. The top layer is finished with a generous spread of grated Mozzarella and then baked until thoroughly heated and the cheese is bubbly and browned.</p>
