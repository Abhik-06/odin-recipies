    <p>The Kerala Sadya is a vegetarian banquet served on a banana leaf, defined by its variety. The preparation centers on several essential curries, including a vegetable and lentil stew called Sambar, and a thick yogurt-coconut-based mixed vegetable curry called Avial. Key side dishes include dry stir-fried vegetables with coconut (Thoran) and yogurt-based preparations like Pachadi. The meal is served over boiled Kerala Matta Rice, with several courses of sweet Payasam (pudding) to conclude the feast.</p>
