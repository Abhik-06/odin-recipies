    <p>Vadapav is prepared by first boiling and mashing potatoes, which are then mixed with a tempering of mustard seeds, curry leaves, and green chilies. These seasoned potatoes are shaped into balls (Vada), coated in a thick besan (gram flour) batter, and deep-fried. The finished Vada is placed inside a sliced Pav (soft dinner roll) that has been generously spread with both a spicy dry garlic chutney (red powder) and a sweet-and-sour tamarind chutney. It is served immediately with a fried green chili.</p>
