    <p>The Dosa batter requires soaking and grinding rice and urad dal (black lentils) into a smooth consistency, followed by an overnight fermentation until it rises. The thin, fermented batter is then spread quickly on a hot, oiled griddle to cook until crispy. Medu Vada is made from a separate, very thick batter of soaked and ground urad dal, seasoned with ginger and spices. This dough is shaped into small rings and deep-fried until golden brown. Both are traditionally served with Sambar and Coconut Chutney.</p>
