    <p>Biryani is built on a layering technique called dum. Start by marinating your protein (chicken or mutton) in yogurt and biryani masala. Separately, par-cook long-grain Basmati rice with whole spices. In a pot, alternate layers of the marinated meat, the partially cooked rice, fried onions, and fresh herbs (mint, cilantro). Seal the pot tightly and cook on a very low flame until the meat is tender and the rice is aromatic.</p>
